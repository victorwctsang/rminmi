Description: This package estimates extinction time from a set of fossil ages, together with measurement error standard deviations. The endpoint of the interval over which fossil data are available is also required. Recovery potential is assumed to be constant over the interval, and uncertainty estimating fossil ages is assumed to be independent across specimens and normally distributed. Inversion of the sample minimum is used to find and exact confidence interval for extinction time, under the above assumptions.
    This package can also be used to estimate either endpoint of stratigraphic data (assuming the other is known), that is, it could also be used to estiamte invasion or speciation times, see `minmi` help file for details.
